# FrameShift2 
Surrealism Comes Alive: Step into 3D Dimensions

## Goal of this Project
FrameShift2 is a art-adaption project that aims to transform a 2D surrealistic painting into a captivating 3D scene. By leveraging the relatively unknown capabilities of the [Tilt Five AR glasses](https://www.tiltfive.com/), this project seeks to bring surrealism to life in a way that traditional 2D art cannot.

This project is heavily inspired by one very famous surrealistic painting "Der Hausengel" or "L'Ange du foyer" by Max Ernst and its "Version 4", which premiered at the Biennale 2022 in Venice. The painting was transposed and animated into a 2D animation and displayed by a hologram fan.

The project is a cooperation between students of HTW Berlin of the majors "Communication Design" and "Computer Science in culture and health". The project is supervised by [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Johann Habakuk Israel](https://www.htw-berlin.de/hochschule/personen/person/?eid=4743) and [Prof. Andreas Ingerl](https://www.htw-berlin.de/hochschule/personen/person/?eid=4388).
